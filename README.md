# Bad-Bank
## Bad Bank Project
<img src="badbankimage.png" width='300'/>
This bad bank is so named because it does not have security (no login or logout). It does, however, contain a page with an input field whereby someone can enter a name, email, and password. A list of names, emails, and passwords is collected and displayed on the All Data page, which is a table within a Bootstrap card. There is a deposit page and a withdraw page as well, with balance that is updated as amounts are entered. Error messages keep the user on the right track as far as what and how much can be deposited and withdrawn. This project was created using React.<br></br>
To run this on your machine, download the files and start an http-server from your terminal or from VSCode (or Liveserver from VS Code). A video walkthrough of the project can be found at https://www.canva.com/design/DAFvmdZhHsU/Sbfix1bvwHTcm6z3u54j5g/watch?utm_content=DAFvmdZhHsU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink. <br></br>
Additional functionality that would be helpful to a user for future iterations would be to merge the balances of the deposit and withdraw pages and to include secure login and log out.<br></br>
